# Performance

- Raspberry Pi Zero W is able to process CSI camera (Rpi Cam v2) and USB 2k camera
  but it has load average about 1.4, and CPU is quite well utilized, so you may
  need to decrease resolution per camera to see how it goes.

- ffdshow is usually noticeably slow and cpu intensive if you do more complex operations
