# Install script as service

Depending on the distro there are various options to configure scripts as service.

* [systemd](./service.systemd.md) - most common service on Linux systems
* [docker](./service.docker.md) - run as Docker container
* [kubernetes](./service.kubernetes.md) - run on Kubernetes

Other - not implemented, do it on your own.
