# Configuration Env Vars

## Minimum required env vars

Config for camera is to the script as environment variables (env vars).

The most important env vars are:

* `PRUSA_CONNECT_CAMERA_TOKEN`
* `PRUSA_CONNECT_CAMERA_FINGERPRINT`
* `CAMERA_COMMAND`
* `CAMERA_COMMAND_EXTRA_PARAMS`

Those env vars will be filled in the next steps.

Full list of env vars can be seen [here](./configuration.env.full.md)
